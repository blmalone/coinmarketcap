/*
	Closures in Javascript
	A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
	Inner functions have access to the variables of outer functions.

*/
//This is an example of lexical scoping. The word "lexical" refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses
// the location where a variable is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available.
function init() {
    var name = "Mozilla"; // name is a local variable created by init
    function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
        console.log(name); // displayName() uses variable declared in the parent function    
    }
    displayName();    
}
init();


/*
	In some programming languages, the local variables within a function exist only
	for the duration of that function's execution. Once makeFunc() has finished executing,
	you might expect that the name variable would no longer be accessible. 
	However, because the code still works as expected, this is obviously not the case in JavaScript.

	The reason is that functions in JavaScript form closures. A closure is the combination of a 
	function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment 
	consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.
	In this case, myFunc is a reference to the instance of the function displayName
	created when makeFunc is run. The instance of displayName maintains a reference
	to its lexical environment, within which the variable name exists.
	For this reason, when myFunc is invoked, the variable name remains available for 
	use and "Mozilla" is passed to console.log().
*/

  var name = 'Mozilla';
  function displayName() {
    console.log('Closure Example 2: ', name);
  }
  return displayName;//being returned from makeFunc() without being executed. 
}

var myFunc = makeFunc();
myFunc();


/*
	It is unwise to unnecessarily create functions within other functions if closures
	are not needed for a particular task, as it will negatively affect script performance
	both in terms of processing speed and memory consumption.

	For instance, when creating a new object/class, methods should normally be associated
	to the object's prototype rather than defined into the object constructor.
	The reason is that whenever the constructor is called, the methods would get reassigned
	(that is, for every object creation).


*/

//For example consider the following case: This code does not take advantage of closures.
function MyObject(name, message) {
  this.name = name.toString();
  this.message = message.toString();
  this.getName = function() {
    return this.name;
  };

  this.getMessage = function() {
    return this.message;

}
//The above code could be rewritten as follows...
function MyObject(name, message) {
  this.name = name.toString();
  this.message = message.toString();
}
MyObject.prototype = {
  getName: function() {
    return this.name;
  },
  getMessage: function() {
    return this.message;

/*
	However, redefining the prototype is not recommended. 
	The following example instead appends to the existing prototype:
